        <p> It Helps in increasing the knowledge.Books are an important part of our life. We read many kinds of books. We study text books at school that are part of our syllabus. We also have story books that we read for leisure and fun. We can get them from the school library. We can also buy them from bookshops. Books are printed on paper, and can have pictures too that make them interesting. We can read books on the computer as well. I love reading children’s stories published in colourful books, as they are beautifully presented. Books are our ultimate helper when it comes to the gain of knowledge and eventually achieves wisdom.
